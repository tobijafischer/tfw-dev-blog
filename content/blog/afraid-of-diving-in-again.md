# How to dive back into a stale project

Every once in a while, I find myself struggling to dive back into a project because I really don't know where to start anymore. There are serveral ways to get back to it:

1. Find (or invent) the smallest possible task that brings the most joy possible.
2. Commit to a fixed time of only about 30 minutes to dive into the project again. Spin up some good music and see if you can get into flow state during that time. If not, don't be disencouraged, just repeat the process the next day.
